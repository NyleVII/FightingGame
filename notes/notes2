Turn-based Team Battle System with Cards
========================================


Summary
-------

- turn-based combat with teams of three creatures
- creatures have individual health points and abilities
- players take turns, expending energy to play cards and use creature abilities
- the first player to defeat all three of their opponent's creatures wins


Setup
-----

- players queue up to a game with a deck of N cards, used to affect the battlefield and interact with the creatures in various ways
- creature teams could be initialized in a few ways:
	- preselect a team of three along with the effect deck before queuing
	- players queue with a "creature deck" from which their team is randomly selected/mulliganed
	- purely random from all possible creatures
		- mulligan phase?
	- creatures could be drafted somehow (perhaps the game randomly selects 6 creatures and players take turns drafting a team)


Combat
------

- the main game loop is comprised of turn-based combat
- each player starts at N max energy
- effect cards and creature abilities have an associated energy cost, which is expended from their energy total for that turn
- energy is replenished back up to the player's max energy at the beginning of each turn
- any card or ability can be used in any order during the turn, provided the player has enough energy to do so
- creatures occupy a space from 1-3 on the field (this impacts whether or not they can be hit by or use certain abilities - see darkest dungeon)
