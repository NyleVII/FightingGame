Game Design Document for "Fighting Game"

3v3 combat of creatures augmented with cards

Creature characteristics:
    - Each creature has properties
        health
        power
        passive
    - Each creature can only learn one ability at a time


What differentiates creatures from one another?
    - starting "power" of their ability 
        Power is a measurement of how potent an ability is (3 dmg == 3 power? for example)
    - starting health
    - one starting ability (Deal damage, heal, draw card, protect, etc.)
    - passive effects (on death, trigger, auras, evolution)


Teaching a creature a different ability will be uncommon
    Generally strong, meant for late game

For later design:
    Board effects
        Weather? (fog, rain, etc.)
        Enchantments
