Combat mechanic possibilities
1. creatures have attack that is added to ability damage
	PRO: relatively simple, allows for some synergy
	CON: not very deep, less flexible

2. ability damage multiplies with creature attack
	- flat ability multiplied by creature attack
	- flat creature attack multiplied by ability
	
3. just abilities with no creature attack
	PRO: simple, consistent

4. creatures just have attack, there is no interaction with ability damage
5. position affects abilities, attack, health
6. creatures have role archetypes that affect ability damage, healing capability, etc
7. creatures have elemental affinity




Ideas
- ranged and melee
	- melee is generally stronger but has positional considerations
		- take damage from creatures when attacking past the first position
		- costs more energy to attack back/middle row
